Introduction
------------

This python package provides methods and utilities to explore the PnP algorithm and MACE framework in the context
of image reconstruction problems, along with some simple demos.  The ideas leading to this package are outlined in

* `A SIAM News overview article from March 2021`_
* `The 2020 SIAM Imaging Sciences Best Paper Award lecture`_

Installation and Demos
======================

From a terminal in linux or MacOS, change to the dev_scripts directory, and enter::

    source clean_install_all.sh
    conda activate pnp_mace

This will create and activate a conda environment called pnp_mace.

Then change to the demo directory and and enter::

    python ct_mace.py

(or use any of the other .py files in the demo directory).
